> [!CAUTION]
> If the module I created causes a bootlop, it is at your own risk    
> I have tested it on several devices below.
<hr/>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This module changes the DNS configuration on Android using Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1 & 1.0.0.1) via Magisk. Make sure :
> - The device is rooted
> - The system supports iptables and IPv6 if you want full compatibility.
