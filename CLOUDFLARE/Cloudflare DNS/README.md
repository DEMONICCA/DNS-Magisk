<hr/>

> [!NOTE]
> - This module aims to optimize DNS and network connections on Android devices.
> - Using root methods such as magisk, kernelsu, or apatch to get system access.
> - This module most likely supports Android 7.0 (Nougat) and above.
> - Adjust the configuration of TCP/IP, Wi-Fi, and DNS resolution to increase internet speed.
> - Change IPTABLES rules to repay all DNS requests to the cloudflare server (1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1 for IPv4 and 2606: 4700: 4700 :: 1111, 2606: 4700: 4700: :: 4700 :: 1001 for IPV6).
> - Remove the cache system and dalvik-cache after the application of the configuration.
<hr/>

> [!WARNING]
> - Only for devices with root access. This module will not run without root access and will come out with errors.
> - Change Selinux settings to "permissive" (setenforce 0), which can reduce system security.
> - Disables private DNS on Android 10 and above for compatibility, which may have an impact on certain security features.
> - Changes in Iptables can cause conflict with firewalls or other security applications.
> - Removing the cache system that can cause the application takes longer to load after rebooting.

> [!CAUTION]
> If the module I make causes BOOTLOOP, that is your own risk. I will not be responsible if a problem occurs. Not all ROMs are profitable, so be careful.

> [!IMPORTANT]
